<!--
When you create a new SwiftUI app, you’ll get a selection of files and maybe 100 lines of code in total. Most of the code doesn’t do anything, and is just there as placeholders to give you something to fill in – you can safely ignore it for now, but as you progress through this course that will change. -->

当你创建了一个 SwiftUI 应用, 你将得到一个一些文件，也许有 100 多行代码。

大部分代码没有什么作用，只是作为占位符给你填一些东西 - 现在你可以暂时忽略它们，但是后面的课程会需要使用到他们。

<!-- 
Inside Xcode you should see the following files in the space on the left, which is called the project navigator:

- AppDelegate.swift contains code for managing your app. It used to be common to add code here, but these days it’s quite rare.
- SceneDelegate.swift contains code for launching one window in your app. This doesn’t do much on iPhone, but on iPad – where users can have multiple instances of your app open at the same time – this is important.
- ContentView.swift contains the initial user interface (UI) for your program, and is where we’ll be doing all the work in this project.
- Assets.xcassets is an asset catalog – a collection of pictures that you want to use in your app. You can also add colors here, along with app icons, iMessage stickers, and more.
- LaunchScreen.storyboard is a visual editor for creating a small piece of UI to show when your app is launching.
- Info.plist is a collection of special values that describe to the system how your app works – which version it is, which device orientations you support, and more. Things that aren’t code, but are still important.
- Preview Content is a yellow group, with Preview Assets.xcassets inside – this is another asset catalog, this time specifically for example images you want to use when you’re designing your user interfaces, to give you an idea of how they might look when the program is running.
-->
你可以在 Xcode 左边栏看到一些文件，这叫项目导航栏：

- `AppDelegate.swift` 包含管理应用程序的代码，以前经常会在这里添加代码，但是现在很少。
- `SceneDelegate.swift` 还有应用启动窗口的代码，这些在 iPhone 没什么用，但是在 iPad - 哪些用户可以在任意时间拥有多个实例 - 这很重要
- `ContentView.swift` 包含你的程序最初始的用户界面，这也是我们将在这个项目做的所有工作。
- `Assets.xcassets` 是一个资源目录 - 你想在这个程序使用的图片集合。你也可以在这里添加颜色，应用的 icons，iMessage 的贴纸，以及更多。
- `LaunchScreen.storyboard` 是一个创建应用启动界面的视图编辑器。
- `Info.plist` 是一个关注你的应用如何在系统工作的特殊值集合 - 当前应用是哪个版本，支持哪些设备方向，以及更多。
这些不是代码，但是很重要。
- `Preview Content` 是一个内部使用 `Preview Assets.xcassets` 单独资源目录，这里专门给您存放想要设计用户界面时的示例图片，让你看看程序运行时候的样子。

<!--
All our work for this project will take place in ContentView.swift, which Xcode will already have opened for you. It has some comments at the top – those things marked with two slashes at the start – and they are ignored by Swift, so you can use them to add explanations about how your code works.

Below the comments are ten or so lines of code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World")
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
-->
我们在这里项目的所有工作都将在 `ContentView.swift` 进行，其中 Xcode 将已经打开给你。

在顶部有一些注释 - 在开始的地方标记了两个斜线的东西 - Swift 会忽略他们，所以你可以使用他们来解释关于你的代码如何工作。

注释下面是十来行的代码：
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World")
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

<!--
Before we start writing our own code, it’s worth going over what all that does, because a couple of things will be new.

First, import SwiftUI tells Swift that we want to use all the functionality given to us by the SwiftUI framework. Apple provides us with many frameworks for things like machine learning, audio playback, image processing, and more, so rather than assume our program wants to use everything ever we instead say which parts we want to use so they can be loaded.

-->
我们在开始写代码之前，让我们看看这些代码的作用。

首先，`import SwiftUI` 表示我们想使用所有的 SwiftUI 框架的功能。
苹果公司为机器学习提供了多种框架，语音播放，图片处理，以及更多。所以这里使用 `import` 来告诉 Swift 我们需要加载哪些框架，而不是全部的框架。

<!-- 
Second, struct ContentView: View creates a new struct called ContentView, saying that it conforms to the View protocol. View comes from SwiftUI, and is the basic protocol that must be adopted by anything you want to draw on the screen – all text, buttons, images, and more are all views, including your own layouts that combine other views.
-->
第二，`struct ContentView: View` 创建一个叫做 `Contentview` 的新结构体，继承 `View`。
`View` 来自 SwiftUI，任何你想在屏幕出现的东西都必须继承于它 - 所有文本，按钮，图片，以及更多视图，包括你的布局和其他视图。

<!-- 
Third, var body: some View defines a new computed property called body, which has an interesting type: some View. This means it will return something that conforms to the View protocol, but that extra some keyword adds an important restriction: it must always be the same kind of view being returned – you can’t sometimes return one type of thing and other times return a different type of thing.
-->

<!--
We’ll look at this feature more shortly, but for now just remember that it means “one specific sort of view must be sent back from this property.”

The View protocol has only one requirement, which is that you have a computed property called body that returns some View. You can (and will) add more properties and methods to your view structs, but body is the only thing that’s required.

Fourth, Text("Hello World") creates a text view using the string “Hello World”. Text views are simple pieces of static text that get drawn onto the screen, and will automatically wrap across multiple lines as needed.

Below the ContentView struct you’ll see a ContentView_Previews struct, which conforms to the PreviewProvider protocol. This piece of code won’t actually form part of your final app that goes to the App Store, but is instead specifically for Xcode to use so it can show a preview of your UI design alongside your code.

These previews use an Xcode feature called the canvas, which is usually visible directly to the right of your code. You can customize the preview code if you want, and they will only affect the way the canvas shows your layouts – it won’t change the actual app that gets run.

Xcode can only show the canvas on macOS Catalina or later. If you don’t see the canvas and are already running Catalina, go to the Editor menu and select Canvas.

If you don’t have Catalina, you’ll need to run your code in the Simulator in order to see how it looks.

Tip: Very often you’ll find that an error in your code stops Xcode’s canvas from updating – you’ll see something like “Automatic preview updating paused”, and can press Resume to fix it. As you’ll be doing this a lot, let me recommend an important shortcut: Option+Cmd+P does the same as clicking Resume.
